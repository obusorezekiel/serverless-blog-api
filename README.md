# Serverless Blog API

This project creates a serverless blog API using **AWS API Gateway**, **AWS Lambda**, **AWS DynamoDB**, and **Python**. The infrastructure is managed using **Terraform**, allowing seamless deployment and management of cloud resources.

## Project Overview

The **Serverless Blog API** is designed to provide basic blog functionality with **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations using a fully serverless architecture. All blog posts are stored in a DynamoDB table, and all operations are handled via AWS Lambda functions. The API is accessible via API Gateway.

## Architecture

The architecture of the project includes the following components:
1. **API Gateway**: Manages and routes HTTP requests to the appropriate Lambda functions.
2. **Lambda Functions**: Serve as the backend logic, handling requests and performing CRUD operations.
3. **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for storing blog posts.
4. **Terraform**: Used to provision and manage AWS resources.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for Lambda function development.
- **AWS Lambda** to execute backend logic.
- **AWS API Gateway** to expose the API to users.
- **AWS DynamoDB** for storing blog data.
- **Terraform** to manage infrastructure as code.

## Features

- **Create** blog posts.
- **Read** individual blog posts or all posts.
- **Update** existing blog posts.
- **Delete** blog posts.
- Full serverless deployment using **AWS Lambda**, **API Gateway**, and **DynamoDB**.
- **Terraform** as the infrastructure-as-code tool.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **AWS CLI**: You need to configure the AWS CLI with appropriate credentials.
- **Terraform**: Install Terraform to manage the infrastructure.
- **Python**: Python for local development and packaging Lambda functions.
- **AWS Account**: Ensure you have an AWS account with sufficient privileges.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/serverless-blog-api.git
    cd serverless-blog-api
    ```

2. Install **Terraform** if you haven’t already. Follow the instructions from the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

3. Install **AWS CLI** and configure it with your AWS account:

    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

### Configuration

Edit `variables.tf` to customize the project to your specific AWS region or DynamoDB table name:

```hcl
variable "aws_region" {
  default = "us-west-2"
}

variable "dynamodb_table" {
  default = "blog_posts"
}
```

### Deploying the Infrastructure

1. Navigate to the project directory and initialize Terraform:

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

2. Plan the infrastructure deployment:

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

3. Apply the configuration to deploy the resources:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

   - This command will provision API Gateway, Lambda functions, DynamoDB, and required IAM roles.
   - After deployment, Terraform will output the API Gateway URL for you to use.

### Tearing Down the Infrastructure

To destroy the infrastructure and avoid incurring charges:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## API Endpoints

The following endpoints are available after deployment:

| Method | Endpoint                  | Description                |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| GET    | `/posts`                   | Fetch all blog posts       |
| GET    | `/posts/{postId}`          | Fetch a single blog post   |
| POST   | `/posts`                   | Create a new blog post     |
| PUT    | `/posts/{postId}`          | Update a blog post         |
| DELETE | `/posts/{postId}`          | Delete a blog post         |

### Example Request Payload for POST and PUT:

```json
{
  "title": "My Blog Title",
  "content": "This is the content of the blog post."
}
```

### Response Example for GET (Single Post):

```json
{
  "postId": "12345",
  "title": "My Blog Title",
  "content": "This is the content of the blog post.",
  "createdAt": "2024-09-27T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Testing the API

You can use **Postman**, **curl**, or any API client to test the API endpoints. Here are some example `curl` commands to interact with the API:

### Fetch All Posts

```bash
curl -X GET https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/posts
```

### Fetch a Single Post

```bash
curl -X GET https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/posts/{postId}
```

### Create a New Post

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/posts \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "title": "New Blog Post",
    "content": "This is my blog content."
  }'
```

### Update a Post

```bash
curl -X PUT https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/posts/{postId} \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "title": "Updated Blog Post",
    "content": "This is updated content."
  }'
```

### Delete a Post

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/posts/{postId}
```
